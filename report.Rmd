## Motivation

One metric consistently missing in restaurant recommendation apps is the consideration for sanitary conditions. Combining the Inspection dataset and ratings information from the most popular rating website Yelp, we provide recommendations for restaurants in NYC based on oneâ€™s choice of price range, sanitary grading, location, and cuisine type on our Shiny App. This is particularly useful for those that have higher standards for sanitary conditions. Furthermore, we provide statistical analysis on whether sanitary grades depend on which borough one is dining in, which cuisine type one chooses, and which price range the given restaurant is. This provides formal analysis that could potentially guide consumers on which types of restaurants to choose if they wish to avoid health hazards as much as possible. Finally, we fit multiple linear regression models on Yelp rating and attempt to understand which predictors to be statistically significant. The motivation on this front is to potentially provide insight for investors in the culinary industry on which measures to take (e.g., which borough should they open their restaurant, which price range should they shoot for, how much they should invest in sanitary conditions for the restaurant, etc.) if they wish to ensure the best ratings from platforms like Yelp.

## The Nature of Our Inquiry

### Initial Questions

* What does the dataset we have at hand tell us about the restaurant industry in New York City? For example, what is the geographical distribution of restaurants with respect to price range, cuisine type, and grade(e.g., Washington Heights is dominated by Latin American restaurants)? Is there any pattern with respect to inspection information and cuisine types across different boroughs and price levels? (i.e., EDA)

* What are the factors that influence sanitary grading? As a consumer, does their choice involving the borough of the restaurant, the price range of the restaurant, the cuisine type of their choosing have an effect on the sanitary grading of the restaurant? (i.e, Statistical Tests)

* What is the relationship between reviewer's rating of the restaurant and other variables including inspection score, boroughs, price range, review numbers, cuisine type? If an investor wishes to open a new restaurant and maximize review score on Yelp, which factors should he consider and which areas should he focus on investing in? (e.g., Multiple Linear Regression)

### Along the Way...

* How reliable is the Yelp rating data that we have extracted? There exists a significant positive correlation between review numbers and rating, suggesting that the higher the number of reviews that a restaurant has, the higher its rating tends to be. This creates a potential for some to invest in In this way, how much does bots or paid reviewers influence this outcome of rating? How reliable should a restaurant owner or a consumer depend on this rating to assess the quality of the restaurant?

* How credible is the price variable? The initial "price" variable must had been a numerical variable that is the median/mean spending of an individual in the particular restaurant. However, because of the nature of our data, this variable has been categorized to the levels of 1, 2, 3, 4, though with specific range associated with each. In this way, a restaurant that has a median individual spending of \$100 would appear the same as one that has a median individual spending of \$1000. How much confounding would this create for it as an independent predictor variable?

### Final Thoughts

* Our Shiny App involves a strongly interactive feature that recommends restaurant for one that types their desired price range, location, cuisine type, and sanitary score. However, unlike the NYC Inspection Data and the Yelp Website, which updates daily, our results may not be the most up-to-date. In this way, will there be a feasible way (perhaps through collaboration with Yelp) to develop an recommender that combines the most up-to-date raw data from both Yelp and NYC Inspection Data?


## Related Work

* In an article concerning the [impact of the letter-grade program on restaurant sanitary conditions and dining behaviors in New York City](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2014.302404), it was found that the letter grading system has resulted in improvements in sanitary conditions on unannounced inspection and that it is an effective regulatory tool. In this way, the grading system might be of reference to consumers as well: if a restaurant has not received a grade of "A", it might imply that there exists some serioues health hazards that dining at the restaurant might entail. This underlies the basis for our formal statistical analysis with respect to Inspection grades.

* In a research [article published by Harvard Business School](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1928601), an analysis was done on the efficacy Yelp ratings. Specifically, it was found that an increase in 1 star on Yelp rating leads to a 5-9% increase in revenue, and that such an the effect is driven by individual restaurants and unaffected by chained affiliations. This suggests a practical incentive for restaurant owners to create bloated reviews by using bots or fake reviewers, which adds duplicity of our rating variable.


## Data Collection and Cleaning

We used two data sets to complete our analysis. 

### a. [DOHMH NYC Restaurant Inspection Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j)

This dataset provided by Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) contains detailed information on restaurant inspection results. We downloaded and imported the version updated on Nov. 17th. 
Since this file is too large to be uploaded on Github, we configured Github Large File System to store it and its cleaning results. 

In the process of data cleaning, we formatted variables, identified illegal values and dropped NAs. The distinct restaurants are filtered to be our targets. 

After cleaning, we are mainly focus on variables shown below:

  - `score`: Total score for a particular inspection. The higher the score, the lower the performance and riskier the health hazards.
  
  - `grade`: Grade associated with the inspection. The lower the score, the higher (alphabetically) the grade. 
  
  - `violation_description`: Violation description associated with the  inspection. 
  
  - `critical_flag`: Indicator of critical violation. 

### b. [Yelp Data](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=New+York%2C+NY)

After selecting the first 8000 distinct restaurant with latest inspection records, we extracted their name and location information to generate Yelp searching URLs, and used the corresponding CSS tags to pull real-time information for each restaurant, which includes: 

  - `name`: Restaurant's name. 
  
  - `rating`: Overall rating score given by Yelp users.
  
  - `review_num`: Number of reviews for a specific restaurant.

  - `price`: Average consuming price range for a specific restaurant.
  
  - `distance`: Distance between target location and searching result.

Finally, due to the instability of the website display, we got 6943 restaurants' yelp information in total and kept 6053 entries which were joined with the inspection dataset for subsequent analysis. 

## Exploratory analysis

For our exploratory analyses, we aimed to identify patterns related to inspection information and cuisine types across different boroughs and price levels. Meanwhile, the latent associations between sanitary grading, inspection-related variables, review numbers, and rating are our particular interests. The exploratory analyses consisted of two main parts: visualization and mapping of cuisine types and ratings in different boroughs and at price levels, and visualization and mapping of critical inspection information.

### Visulization of cuisine types and ratings in NYC

Based on our data frame, we get the top 10 popular cuisine types in NYC and in different boroughs across NYC. `American`, `Chinese` are always among people's favorites, while citizens in different boroughs shows their different preferences. Then, we visualized the pattern of the top 10 frequent cuisine at different price, which can be useful when considering the preferences at different levels of consumption. After that, restaurants at different price levels by borough are inspected, and it showed that people living in Manhattan were associated with higher consumption level.

We then discovered the association between review number and review scores. Living in a era full of bots and artificial intelligence, it's interesting to have some inspection on them. We found that for restaurants which got raring scores lower than 3, the review numbers tended to be very small. Meanwhile, the review scores by price levels were visualized. At last, we mapped the geolocation of restaurants by price and cuisine types. In general, Manhattan has the largest number of restaurants and a much denser distribution compared to other boroughs. The proportion of the least and second least expensive restaurants are much higher compared to the proportions of more expensive dining places in Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. In addition, the majority of the restaurants that fall into the most expensive category are located in Manhattan.

### Distribution of Restaurants by Price

As demonstrated by a map, we explored the underlying distribution of restaurants in NYC with respect to price and borough. In general, Manhattan had the largest number of restaurants and a much denser distribution compared to other boroughs. The proportion of the least and second least expensive restaurants were much higher compared to the proportions of more expensive dining places in Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. In addition, the majority of the restaurants that fell into the most expensive category (`$$$$`) were located in Manhattan. 

### Violation 

There were a total of 169 distinct types of violations documented for NYC restaurants, and one restaurant might have fallen into more than one category. After grouping the data by the types of violation, we identified the 10 most frequent violations to gain an understanding of the general problems faced by the restaurants. 

Depending on the seriousness of the violations, Health Code violations are categorized as "critical" or "general (not critical)". Hence, we also calculated the proportions of violations made by each that was categorized as "critical". We found that more than 50 percent of the violations were not critical. In addition, the ratio of critical to non-critical violations was approximately the same across different boroughs of NYC.

We then generated a density heat map to identify an underlying pattern of the distribution of critical flags. According to the density heat map, restaurants with critical violations were more frequently found in some of the busier area of each borough: for instance, Soho and West Village in lower Manhattan, Korean Town in middle Manhattan, Williamsburg in Brooklyn, Jackson Heights and Main Street in Queens, etc. 

In terms of the performance during inspection, the majority of the restaurants in NYC received an "A" as the inspection grade, either during the initial inspection or re-inspection. Among all boroughs in NYC, Bronx was the one with the highest proportion of restaurants receiving a grade "C". Staten Island had the highest proportion of restaurants with grade "A" and no restaurant with grade "C", followed by Manhattan which had the second highest proportion of grade "A" restaurants. 

## Formal Statistical Analysis

In this section, we conducted formal statistical tests and constructed multiple lienar regression model to analyze the data at hand. Specifically, to understand the effects of categorical variables like price range, borough, and cuisine type on inspection grades, we conducted chi-square tests and proportion tests. Moreover, to find adequate predictors for Yelp Rating, we fitted several MLR models using variable model selection techniques and compared their efficacy by performing cross-validation. 

### Statistical Testing: Factors affecting Inspection Grade

In the first part of our statistical analysis, we focused on investigating the factors that influence inspection grades. Specifically, we performed Chi-Square tests on inspection grades against borough and price range, and the results inform us that while the inspection grades significantly differ among different groups of borough at $\alpha = 0.05$, inspection grades do not differ significantly among restaurants with different price range. On the other hand, since receiving an "A" grade is a valid metric for whether the restaurant satisfies high sanitary standards in New York City, we performed proportion test on whether the percentage of restaurants receiving an "A" in inspection grades differ by price range. The result, which runs a bit counterintuitive compared to our previous result, indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in proportion of restaurants receiving "A"s among different price ranges. In other words, when a consumer intends on choosing the restaurant of the best sanitary conditions, the price range of the particular restaurant matter to this choice; though there might not be an overall difference when considering all different inspection grades. Finally, we did proportion tests for each cuisine type that has at least ten restaurants included in our dataset, and concluded that the restaurants that are most likely to have the highest inspection grades are delicatessen(soups/salads/sandwich), followed by

## Shiny app

We developed and deployed an Shiny App for users to get appropriate and interactive recommendations based on their personalized input. 
The interactive app gives user the freedom whether to input a target street. When a text input of street is received, it will be converted to a longitude and latitude coordinate using API provided by [NYC GeoSearch](https://geosearch.planninglabs.nyc/docs/), and the distance between each resulting restaurant and the target location will be calculated and displayed in the resulting table. 

Once clicking the "Search" button, users can view key information for each restaurant satisfying their demands from the resulting table and see the location distribution on the map. 
While the table is sorted by rating values by default, it can be sorted by each variables based on users' preference. 
By clicking a specific entry of the table, the latest inspection records of the corresponding restaurant will be shown in the lower right.
