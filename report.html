<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>One metric consistently missing in restaurant recommendation apps is
the consideration for sanitary conditions. Combining the Inspection
dataset and ratings information from the most popular rating website
Yelp, we provide recommendations for restaurants in NYC based on one’s
choice of price range, sanitary grading, location, and cuisine type on
our Shiny App. This is particularly useful for those that have higher
standards for sanitary conditions. Furthermore, we provide statistical
analysis on whether sanitary grades depend on which borough one is
dining in, which cuisine type one chooses, and which price range the
given restaurant is. This provides formal analysis that could
potentially guide consumers on which types of restaurants to choose if
they wish to avoid health hazards as much as possible. Finally, we fit
multiple linear regression models on Yelp rating and attempt to
understand which predictors to be statistically significant. The
motivation on this front is to potentially provide insight for investors
in the culinary industry on which measures to take (e.g., which borough
should they open their restaurant, which price range should they shoot
for, how much they should invest in sanitary conditions for the
restaurant, etc.) if they wish to ensure the best ratings from platforms
like Yelp.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-nature-of-our-inquiry" class="section level2">
<h2>The Nature of Our Inquiry</h2>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Initial Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>What does the dataset we have at hand tell us about the
restaurant industry in New York City? For example, what is the
geographical distribution of restaurants with respect to price range,
cuisine type, and grade(e.g., Washington Heights is dominated by Latin
American restaurants)? Is there any pattern with respect to inspection
information and cuisine types across different boroughs and price
levels? (i.e., EDA)</p></li>
<li><p>What are the factors that influence sanitary grading? As a
consumer, does their choice involving the borough of the restaurant, the
price range of the restaurant, the cuisine type of their choosing have
an effect on the sanitary grading of the restaurant? (i.e, Statistical
Tests)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the relationship between reviewer’s rating of the
restaurant and other variables including inspection score, boroughs,
price range, review numbers, cuisine type? If an investor wishes to open
a new restaurant and maximize review score on Yelp, which factors should
he consider and which areas should he focus on investing in? (e.g.,
Multiple Linear Regression)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="along-the-way" class="section level3">
<h3>Along the Way…</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>How reliable is the Yelp rating data that we have extracted?
There exists a significant positive correlation between review numbers
and rating, suggesting that the higher the number of reviews that a
restaurant has, the higher its rating tends to be. This creates a
potential for some to invest in In this way, how much does bots or paid
reviewers influence this outcome of rating? How reliable should a
restaurant owner or a consumer depend on this rating to assess the
quality of the restaurant?</p></li>
<li><p>How credible is the price variable? The initial “price” variable
must had been a numerical variable that is the median/mean spending of
an individual in the particular restaurant. However, because of the
nature of our data, this variable has been categorized to the levels of
1, 2, 3, 4, though with specific range associated with each. In this
way, a restaurant that has a median individual spending of $100 would
appear the same as one that has a median individual spending of $1000.
How much confounding would this create for it as an independent
predictor variable?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="final-thoughts" class="section level3">
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our Shiny App involves a strongly interactive feature that
recommends restaurant for one that types their desired price range,
location, cuisine type, and sanitary score. However, unlike the NYC
Inspection Data and the Yelp Website, which updates daily, our results
may not be the most up-to-date. In this way, will there be a feasible
way (perhaps through collaboration with Yelp) to develop an recommender
that combines the most up-to-date raw data from both Yelp and NYC
Inspection Data?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In an article concerning the <a
href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2014.302404">impact
of the letter-grade program on restaurant sanitary conditions and dining
behaviors in New York City</a>, it was found that the letter grading
system has resulted in improvements in sanitary conditions on
unannounced inspection and that it is an effective regulatory tool. In
this way, the grading system might be of reference to consumers as well:
if a restaurant has not received a grade of “A”, it might imply that
there exists some serioues health hazards that dining at the restaurant
might entail. This underlies the basis for our formal statistical
analysis with respect to Inspection grades.</p></li>
<li><p>In a research <a
href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1928601">article
published by Harvard Business School</a>, an analysis was done on the
efficacy Yelp ratings. Specifically, it was found that an increase in 1
star on Yelp rating leads to a 5-9% increase in revenue, and that such
an the effect is driven by individual restaurants and unaffected by
chained affiliations. This suggests a practical incentive for restaurant
owners to create bloated reviews by using bots or fake reviewers, which
adds duplicity of our rating variable.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-collection-and-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Collection and Cleaning</h2>
<p>We used two data sets to complete our analysis.</p>
<div id="a.-dohmh-nyc-restaurant-inspection-data"
class="section level3">
<h3>a. <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j">DOHMH
NYC Restaurant Inspection Data</a></h3>
<p>This dataset provided by Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
(DOHMH) contains detailed information on restaurant inspection results.
We downloaded and imported the version updated on Nov. 17th. Since this
file is too large to be uploaded on Github, we configured Github Large
File System to store it and its cleaning results.</p>
<p>In the process of data cleaning, we formatted variables, identified
illegal values and dropped NAs. The distinct restaurants are filtered to
be our targets.</p>
<p>After cleaning, we are mainly focus on variables shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>score</code>: Total score for a particular inspection. The
higher the score, the lower the performance and riskier the health
hazards.</p></li>
<li><p><code>grade</code>: Grade associated with the inspection. The
lower the score, the higher (alphabetically) the grade.</p></li>
<li><p><code>violation_description</code>: Violation description
associated with the inspection.</p></li>
<li><p><code>critical_flag</code>: Indicator of critical
violation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="b.-yelp-data" class="section level3">
<h3>b. <a
href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&amp;find_loc=New+York%2C+NY">Yelp
Data</a></h3>
<p>After selecting the first 8000 distinct restaurant with latest
inspection records, we extracted their name and location information to
generate Yelp searching URLs, and used the corresponding CSS tags to
pull real-time information for each restaurant, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>name</code>: Restaurant’s name.</p></li>
<li><p><code>rating</code>: Overall rating score given by Yelp
users.</p></li>
<li><p><code>review_num</code>: Number of reviews for a specific
restaurant.</p></li>
<li><p><code>price</code>: Average consuming price range for a specific
restaurant.</p></li>
<li><p><code>distance</code>: Distance between target location and
searching result.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, due to the instability of the website display, we got 6943
restaurants’ yelp information in total and kept 6053 entries which were
joined with the inspection dataset for subsequent analysis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory analysis</h2>
<p>For our exploratory analyses, we aimed to identify patterns related
to inspection information and cuisine types across different boroughs
and price levels. Meanwhile, the latent associations between sanitary
grading, inspection-related variables, review numbers, and rating are
our particular interests. The exploratory analyses consisted of two main
parts: visualization and mapping of cuisine types and ratings in
different boroughs and at price levels, and visualization and mapping of
critical inspection information.</p>
<div id="visulization-of-cuisine-types-and-ratings-in-nyc"
class="section level3">
<h3>Visulization of cuisine types and ratings in NYC</h3>
<p>Based on our data frame, we get the top 10 popular cuisine types in
NYC and in different boroughs across NYC. <code>American</code>,
<code>Chinese</code> are always among people’s favorites, while citizens
in different boroughs shows their different preferences. Then, we
visualized the pattern of the top 10 frequent cuisine at different
price, which can be useful when considering the preferences at different
levels of consumption. After that, restaurants at different price levels
by borough are inspected, and it showed that people living in Manhattan
were associated with higher consumption level.</p>
<p>We then discovered the association between review number and review
scores. Living in a era full of bots and artificial intelligence, it’s
interesting to have some inspection on them. We found that for
restaurants which got raring scores lower than 3, the review numbers
tended to be very small. Meanwhile, the review scores by price levels
were visualized. At last, we mapped the geolocation of restaurants by
price and cuisine types. In general, Manhattan has the largest number of
restaurants and a much denser distribution compared to other boroughs.
The proportion of the least and second least expensive restaurants are
much higher compared to the proportions of more expensive dining places
in Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. In addition, the majority
of the restaurants that fall into the most expensive category are
located in Manhattan.</p>
</div>
<div id="distribution-of-restaurants-by-price" class="section level3">
<h3>Distribution of Restaurants by Price</h3>
<p>As demonstrated by a map, we explored the underlying distribution of
restaurants in NYC with respect to price and borough. In general,
Manhattan had the largest number of restaurants and a much denser
distribution compared to other boroughs. The proportion of the least and
second least expensive restaurants were much higher compared to the
proportions of more expensive dining places in Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn,
and Staten Island. In addition, the majority of the restaurants that
fell into the most expensive category (<code>$$$$</code>) were located
in Manhattan.</p>
</div>
<div id="violation" class="section level3">
<h3>Violation</h3>
<p>There were a total of 169 distinct types of violations documented for
NYC restaurants, and one restaurant might have fallen into more than one
category. After grouping the data by the types of violation, we
identified the 10 most frequent violations to gain an understanding of
the general problems faced by the restaurants.</p>
<p>Depending on the seriousness of the violations, Health Code
violations are categorized as “critical” or “general (not critical)”.
Hence, we also calculated the proportions of violations made by each
that was categorized as “critical”. We found that more than 50 percent
of the violations were not critical. In addition, the ratio of critical
to non-critical violations was approximately the same across different
boroughs of NYC.</p>
<p>We then generated a density heat map to identify an underlying
pattern of the distribution of critical flags. According to the density
heat map, restaurants with critical violations were more frequently
found in some of the busier area of each borough: for instance, Soho and
West Village in lower Manhattan, Korean Town in middle Manhattan,
Williamsburg in Brooklyn, Jackson Heights and Main Street in Queens,
etc.</p>
<p>In terms of the performance during inspection, the majority of the
restaurants in NYC received an “A” as the inspection grade, either
during the initial inspection or re-inspection. Among all boroughs in
NYC, Bronx was the one with the highest proportion of restaurants
receiving a grade “C”. Staten Island had the highest proportion of
restaurants with grade “A” and no restaurant with grade “C”, followed by
Manhattan which had the second highest proportion of grade “A”
restaurants.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="formal-statistical-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Formal Statistical Analysis</h2>
<p>In this section, we conducted formal statistical tests and
constructed multiple lienar regression model to analyze the data at
hand. Specifically, to understand the effects of categorical variables
like price range, borough, and cuisine type on inspection grades, we
conducted chi-square tests and proportion tests. Moreover, to find
adequate predictors for Yelp Rating, we fitted several MLR models using
variable model selection techniques and compared their efficacy by
performing cross-validation.</p>
<div id="statistical-testing-factors-affecting-inspection-grade"
class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical Testing: Factors affecting Inspection Grade</h3>
<p>In the first part of our statistical analysis, we focused on
investigating the factors that influence inspection grades.
Specifically, we performed Chi-Square tests on inspection grades against
borough and price range, and the results inform us that while the
inspection grades significantly differ among different groups of borough
at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>, inspection grades
do not differ significantly among restaurants with different price
range. On the other hand, since receiving an “A” grade is a valid metric
for whether the restaurant satisfies high sanitary standards in New York
City, we performed proportion test on whether the percentage of
restaurants receiving an “A” in inspection grades differ by price range.
The result, which runs a bit counterintuitive compared to our previous
result, indicates that there is a statistically significant difference
in proportion of restaurants receiving “A”s among different price
ranges. In other words, when a consumer intends on choosing the
restaurant of the best sanitary conditions, the price range of the
particular restaurant matter to this choice; though there might not be
an overall difference when considering all different inspection grades.
Finally, we did proportion tests for each cuisine type that has at least
ten restaurants included in our dataset, and concluded that the
restaurants that are most likely to have the highest inspection grades
are delicatessen(soups/salads/sandwich), followed by donuts, salads, and
vegan.</p>
</div>
<div id="multipe-linear-regression-factors-predicting-yelp-rating"
class="section level3">
<h3>Multipe Linear Regression: Factors Predicting Yelp Rating</h3>
<p>The second part of formal statistical analysis involves building a
regression model that predicts rating. In particular, we attempt to
answer the second question raised for statistical analysis: if an
investor is looking to open a new restaurant in New York City, what
factors should he invest in the most? Since the response variable,
rating, is negatively skewed, we performed a square transform on the
data to normalize it. We fitted three models in total, the first by
conducting preliminary analysis on the effect of individual predictors
on the response variable the interaction between independent variables;
the second by using the criterion-based method for model prediction, and
the third by using backward selection. We then performed
cross-validation on these three models to compare their efficacy. In
conclusion, the first model provides the least RMSE and is regarded as
the optimal of three. In particular, this model predicts that price
range, borough, the number of reviews, the percentage of critical flags
received by the restaurant out of all violations, and the interaction
between review number and price range are all statistically significant
predictors of rating. One particular point to note is in all our
attempts to fit score as an independent variable and also from our
correlation analysis, it could not be shown to be a statistically
significant predictor for sq_rating. Therefore, if I were a restaurant
owner, I would invest in such criterions as price range, borough, number
of Yelp reviews(maybe to hire bots) so as to maximize my Yelp review
rating, and incidentally, wealth; than to pay any attention on improving
my sanitary condition.</p>

<h2>Shiny app</h2>
<p>We developed and deployed an Shiny App for users to get appropriate
and interactive recommendations based on their personalized input. The
interactive app gives user the freedom whether to input a target street.
When a text input of street is received, it will be converted to a
longitude and latitude coordinate using API provided by <a
href="https://geosearch.planninglabs.nyc/docs/">NYC GeoSearch</a>, and
the distance between each resulting restaurant and the target location
will be calculated and displayed in the resulting table.</p>
<p>Once clicking the “Search” button, users can view key information for
each restaurant satisfying their demands from the resulting table and
see the location distribution on the map. While the table is sorted by
rating values by default, it can be sorted by each variables based on
users’ preference. By clicking a specific entry of the table, the latest
inspection records of the corresponding restaurant will be shown in the
lower right.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>There are quite a few improvements possible for our study. In
particular, upon constructing our regression model, model diagnostics
analysis indicate that our model has violated the assumptions of
linearity, equal variance, and have several outliers. Our natural next
step would be to research other forms of modeling that might overcome
these violations. Furthermore, as stated formerly, our Shiny App, though
extremely versatile and practical, don’t have access to real-time
dataset to update daily as do the NYC Inspection Data or the Yelp
Website. Therefore, the logical next step will be for us to incorporate
the updating nature and produce an app that provides recommendation
using the most recent data.s</p>
